# KD_Tree_Project
CS 315 (Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis) Collaborative Project

## Project Overview
A KD-tree (k-dimensional tree) implementation in C. A KD-tree is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space.

## Team Members

## Building

### Windows (Recommended)
```batch
build.bat
```

### Linux/Mac (or Windows with Make installed)
```bash
make
```

## Running
```bash
# Windows
kd_tree.exe

# Linux/Mac
./kd_tree
```

## Testing
Run the executable:
```bash

./kd_tree
```

## Division of Work
1. **Core Structures** (Assignment A): Implement point structures, node structures, and utility functions
2. **Insertion Operations** (Assignment B): Implement tree insertion and balancing logic
3. **Search & Delete Operations** (Assignment C): Implement search, nearest neighbor, and deletion operations
